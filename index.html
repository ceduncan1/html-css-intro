    <p>Glassblowing is awesome. It all began in Italy centuries ago, but didn't become an artistic medium of much importance in the United States until the middle of the twentieth century.</p>

  <div class=favorites>
  <p>Here are some of my favorite current glass artists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.chihuly.com/">Dale Chihuly</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.marvinlipofsky.com/">Marvin Lipofsky</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.stephenrolfepowell.com/">Stephen Rolfe Powell</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://linotagliapietra.com/">Lino Tagliapietra</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here they are in order of my favorite to my only slightly less favorite:</p>

  <p class=description>That's one of Steve's "Teasers".</p>
  <p>How about another picture?</p>

  <p class=description>These are several of Lino's pieces that make up one installation.  It isn't hard to see how his work influences Steve's.</p>
<p> We can't leave Chihuly and Lipofsky out!</p>

  <p class=description>One of Chihuly's pieces that was featured at our own Atlanta Botanical Gardens.</p>

<p class=description>A very typical and very psychadelic piece by Marvin Lipofsky.</p>
  <p>There really is nothing 100 percent comparable to glass art and the people to dedicate their lives to it.  So, in short(ish), everyone should find a glassblower and give him or her a high-five.</p>
